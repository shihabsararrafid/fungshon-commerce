# Basic Information about the webpage


## For Easy optimization I have divided the components in a folder structure where I put all the pages in one folder , shared page in one folder and custom hooks in another folder
### Moreover all the pages are divided into many components

# How will run the website
<P>First off all when the page will load there will be shown a loader until the full data is loaded . </p>
<p>Then There will loaded a top promotion type header which will be at the top of the page and is available at every page . so it has been put on shared folder .</p>
<p>After that there is a header where there are five routes
