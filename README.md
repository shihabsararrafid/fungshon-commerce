# Basic Information about the webpage


## For Easy optimization I have divided the components in a folder structure where I put all the pages in one folder , shared page in one folder and custom hooks in another folder
### Moreover all the pages are divided into many components

# How will run the website
<P>First off all when the page will load there will be shown a loader until the full data is loaded . </p>
<p>Then There will loaded a top promotion type header which will be at the top of the page and is available at every page . so it has been put on shared folder .</p>
<p>After that there is a header where there are five routes 


</p>
<h1>Home</h1> 
<h1>About</h1> 
<h1>Shop</h1> 
<h1>Blog</h1> 
<h1>Pages</h1> 


# HOME
<p>In this route there are banner,counter,Special Benefit , Collection , Feature product , popular products,collection ,subscription components </p>
<p>If I click the 'check now' button on every collection page it will move us to the that type category product</p>

<h1>Popular Products</h1>
<p>On popluar product the best product on the basis of rating has been shown . If we hover every product we will see a **Add to cart** button which will eventually add the item to cart . There are two more icon , one is **eye ** icon by clicking this we go to the detail page of that product . Which is described in the 2nd page of figma design</p>
